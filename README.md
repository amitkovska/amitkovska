👋 Hello world!
I’m Aleksandra Mitkovska and i'm just entering the world of web developing.👩🏻‍💻
I have one more month of my course at SEAVUS Educational and Development Center and i will have a certificate of being Full-Stack Developer.How exciting!
However, I know that this web world is a lot more complex and i need to learn everyday new things to be up to date with the fast moving industry.
But, that shouldn't be a problem since I consider myself fast-learner because i'm very curious and eager to learn.

I have advanced knowledge of HTML(HTML5),CSS(CSS3) and JavaScript because currently i'm spending my days experimenting with front end tehnologies. For this purpose i got familiar with Figma too, where i draw my projects ideas and wireframes which i apsolutely enjoy doing. It helps me SEE the idea that i have in mind and it saves me time when coding.😉

I also have basic knowledge of web API's , SQL and C# and i'm willing to spend more time understanding and mastering the back end of the web developing.


In the next weeks i will try to put some projects in here so you can see what i'm about.
If you like it you can contact me by email : aleksandra.mitkovska95@hotmail.com 



💞️ FUN FACT:
My previous education is in the field of Psychology and i have Bachelor's degree.My thesis was "Motivation at work" and i wanted to continue with industrial-organizational psychology.But something just wasn't right, i didn't feel complete. 
Once i saw a friend of mine write code and change the whole white blank page into something very colorful and exciting with pictures,text, menus etc.. i felt in love and and started the process of completely changing my career path. Now i'm here at the begining of a new chapter in my life. 🥰
